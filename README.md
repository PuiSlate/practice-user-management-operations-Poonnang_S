I've learned how to manipulate data by using in-depth SQL commands and clauses. The most challenging for me to understand is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses. The main thing to keep in mind is GROUP BY clause. WHERE filters rows before GROUP BY; while HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY. I have to learn to think of SQL as a pipeline how each query runs in order.
